# Pantry Pal

## Background and Overview
Unused food and leftovers are a problem everyone faces. Ever find yourself unsure of what you can make with that half full bottle of teriyaki sauce? $165 billion worth of food is wasted each year by Americans. Pantry Pal solves this problem by searching a recipe database and determining which recipes are readily available to make. Users can customize their list of current ingredients and find new or favorite recipes to make.

## Functionality and MVP
* Users will be able to create accounts and sign in
* User profiles will include ingredient lists for users to add or remove items
* Index of recipes sorted by availability of ingredients
* Show pages for recipes listing ingredients, substitute ingredient, and directions

### Bonus
* Add your own recipes
* Favorite recipes
* Machine Learning to suggest recipes based on your ingredients history

## Technologies and Technical Challenges
### MEAN Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Frontend: Angular
Spoonacular API for recipe data

## Things to be Accomplished Over the Weekend
* Going through MEAN Stack tutorials and docs
* Start MongoDB and Node Backend test basic API calls (on a free API)
* Set up node backend and user authentication
